    "_According to the **Academic Integrity Policy** of this course, all work submitted for grading must be done individually, unless otherwise specified. While we encourage you to talk to your peers and learn from them, this interaction must be superficial with regards to all work submitted for grading. This means you cannot work in teams, you cannot work side-by-side, you cannot submit someone elseâ€™s work (partial or complete) as your own. In particular, note that you are guilty of academic dishonesty if you extend or receive any kind of unauthorized assistance. Absolutely no transfer of program code between students is permitted (paper or electronic), and you may not solicit code from family, friends, or online forums. Other examples of academic dishonesty include emailing your program to another student, copying-pasting code from the internet, working in a group on a homework assignment, and allowing a tutor, TA, or another individual to write an answer for you. Academic dishonesty is unacceptable, and penalties range from failure to expulsion from the university; cases are handled via the official student conduct process described at https://dos.uic.edu/conductforstudents.shtml._\n",
    "\n",
    "_Authorship effort on any submitted work must be accurately documented. Artificial Intelligence tools like **ChatGPT** represent a new paradigm in academic learning. Their use is permitted for this assignment but should be used with caution. These systems often make mistakes and are best used when incorporated with user knowledge and experience, so try to actually learn the material in order to use these tools effectively. The main ideas and authorship of submitted work should be yours and the help must be clearly documented. At the end of this assignment, you are asked to write a \"Use of AI tools statement.\" You may want to look at the format of this statement **before** you start working on the homework, in order to understand what docomentation you are expected to provide._\n",

    "This homework is an **individual assignment for all graduate students**. **Undergraduate students are allowed to work in pairs and submit one homework assignment per pair**. There will be no extra credit given to undergraduate students who choose to work alone. The pairs of students who choose to work together and submit one homework assignment together still need to abide by the Academic Integrity Policy and not share or receive help from others (except each other).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two parts in this homework. In the first one you will practice data processing with `pandas` (45%). In the second one you will practice web scraping and data collection (50%). You will also be given 5% for explaining whether and how you used AI tools.\n",

Write two functions, `extract_hour` and `extract_mins` that converts military time to hours and minutes, respectively. Hint: You may want to use modular arithmetic and integer division.

    "## Authentication and working with APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various authentication schemes that APIs use, listed here in relative order of complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "* No authentication\n",
    "* [HTTP basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)\n",
    "* Cookie based user login\n",
    "* OAuth (v1.0 & v2.0, see this [post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4113934/how-is-oauth-2-different-from-oauth-1) explaining the differences)\n",
    "* API keys\n",
    "* Custom Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "For the NYT example below (**Q2.1**), since it is a publicly visible page we did not need to authenticate. HTTP basic authentication isn't too common for consumer sites/applications that have the concept of user accounts (like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.) but is simple to setup quickly and you often encounter it on with individual password protected pages/sites. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cookie based user login is what the majority of services use when you login with a browser (i.e. username and password). Once you sign in to a service like Facebook, the response stores a cookie in your browser to remember that you have logged in (HTTP is stateless). Each subsequent request to the same domain (i.e. any page on `facebook.com`) also sends the cookie that contains the authentication information to remind Facebook's servers that you have already logged in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many REST APIs however use OAuth (authentication using tokens) which can be thought of a programmatic way to \"login\" _another_ user. Using tokens, a user (or application) only needs to send the login credentials once in the initial authentication and as a response from the server gets a special signed token. This signed token is then sent in future requests to the server (in place of the user credentials).\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar concept common used by many APIs is to assign API Keys to each client that needs access to server resources. The client must then pass the API Key along with _every_ request it makes to the API to authenticate. This is because the server is typically relatively stateless and does not maintain a session between subsequent calls from the same client. Most APIs (including Yelp) allow you to pass the API Key via a special HTTP Header: `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>`. Check out the [docs](https://docs.developer.yelp.com/docs/fusion-authentication) for more information.\n",
    "\n",

Most large web scale companies use a combination of authentication and rate limiting to control access to their data to ensure that everyone using it abides.

This is due to pagination and is a safeguard against returning __TOO__ much data in a single request (what would happen if there were for example 100,000 movie theaters?) and can be used in conjuction with _rate limiting_ as well as a way to throttle and protect access to Yelp data.\n",

The Yelp API gives us aggregate information on ratings but it doesn't give us the review text or individual users' ratings for a business.

For data science and _programatic_ analysis this raw form is quite ideal, but for an end user requesting information from a _graphical interface_ (like a web browser) this is very far from ideal since it takes some cognitive overhead to interpret the raw information.

    "After executing all commands and completing this notebook, save your *hw1.ipynb* as a pdf file and upload it to Gradescope under *Homework 1 (written)*. Make sure you check that your pdf file includes all parts of your solution **(including the outputs)**. We recommend using the browser (not jupyter) for saving the pdf. For Chrome on a Mac, this is under *File->Print...->Open PDF in Preview* and when the PDF opens in Preview you can use *Save...* to save it. This part will be graded based on completion (having executed the code and showing the output) and it constitutes *60%* of HW 1.\n",

    "Next, you need to copy the functions from Questions 1.1 and 1.2 into the corresponding functions in *hw1part1.py*. Similarly, you need to copy the functions from Questions 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6 into the corresponding functions in *hw1part2.py*. Place your files *hw1part1.py*, *hw1part2.py*, and *hw1.ipynb* in a zip file and upload the zip file to Gradescope under *Homework 1 - (code)*. This part constitutes *40%* of HW 1. In order to get full points for this part, you need to pass all test cases that we will run against your *hw1part1.py* and *hw1part2.py* (and not the notebook) on Gradescope. We have provided a sample of the test cases in *tests_sample_part1/tests.py* and *tests_sample_part2/tests.py*. Other tests are hidden on the Gradescope server. To check whether your code runs locally, run the four tests in *tests_sample_part1* from your command line: "
